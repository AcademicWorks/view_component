# ViewComponent

A framework for building reusable, testable & encapsulated view components in Ruby on Rails.

## Design philosophy

ViewComponent is designed to integrate as seamlessly as possible [with Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/), with the [least surprise](https://www.artima.com/intv/ruby4.html).

## Installation

In `Gemfile`, add:

```ruby
gem "view_component", require: "view_component/engine"
```
